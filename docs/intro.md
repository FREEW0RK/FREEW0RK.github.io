## Motivation

### Office work and its negative impact on human beings
In today's world, people have to do more and more digital work. Until before Covid, the office was in most cases the only place where people did this work. Offices are often cramped, stuffy, dark or overcrowded with artificial light. Open, light-flooded workplaces are usually only available on the top executive floors. Who doesn't sometimes dream of a beautiful, wide view or a fresh sea breeze while preparing the next PowerPoint presentation or entering Excel values ​​into tables? The Covid crisis has inevitably shown that more flexible workplace models such as home
-Office work. This has now become an integral part of most everyday working lives. With increasing digitalization, office work will probably become more instead of less in the future. Nevertheless, these jobs are not healthy for people, both mentally and physically. Locked up in narrow spaces under artificial light completely contradicts human nature and evolution. FREEWORK would like to offer people another alternative in addition to the office, home office and coworking and enable digital working from anywhere on earth.

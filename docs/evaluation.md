# FREEWORK Usability Evaluation Design


## User Goals
Find nice FREEWORK spots to work comfortly outdoors & mobile easily by using the app and let the app guide your way to your spot. <!--Include a page to set individual preferences for each user that shows --> 

## Scenarios
The first scenario is to create a new user and navigate to the homepage, which shows different generic places. From here you can use the drawer to navigate thtough teh menu and come to places, where you can add and edit FW places. You also can navigate to the main map or click in the bottom navigation bar "My FW Map" that lets you navigate to a map with different FREEWORK places with different markers depending on a defined area around your current location. The user should be able to zoom in and out of the map, click marker and gain inforamtion about the location and hopefully get automated navigation opportunity to the nice FreeWork spot. Use different spots around campus for different scenarios.  
 
## User Types
First user group would be UH studens and faculty as the beta concentrates on nice FreeWork spots on UH campus. But as you can add nice spots to the database it should work for generic places, too. This results in anyonw who could possible work remotely as User Type. 

## Recruitment
Offer the beta to friends that are grad students at UH and random students on campus and go around with them (and the laptop if OS not matching) and let the app guide us to different nice FREEWORK pots.

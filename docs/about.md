[Christoph Haring](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christophharing/) is a second year Master's student at the University of Hawaii studying Computer Science. His interests includes Quantum Computing, Information Science and Learning Systems. He also graduated in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Engineering and is already working on a PhD in Quantum Information Science. He hopes that FREEWORK will once be a healthy  alternative to office, home-office and coworking and bring people back into nature. Hopefully more humans see the beauty of nature again and how important it is to save it, instead only following economic and power driven interests.
